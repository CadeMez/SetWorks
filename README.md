<h1>JProj - SetWorks</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project investigates the design and implementation of recursive data structures with a focus on binary trees. The assignment required the construction of a BinaryTree class that supports recursive algorithms for insertion, traversal, and structural queries. The work emphasized how recursive definitions of trees naturally support divide-and-conquer algorithms, allowing operations such as searching, height calculation, and node counting to be expressed concisely. Testing involved validating correctness on small examples and analyzing the relationship between tree depth, recursion, and efficiency. The assignment served to illustrate how recursion underpins both the theoretical definition and the practical manipulation of hierarchical data structures in computer science.
